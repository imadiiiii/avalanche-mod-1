## DeFi Kingdom Clone Setup 

## Overview

This guide will help you set up your own DeFi Kingdom clone on the Avalanche network using a custom EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) subnet. You'll learn how to define your native currency, connect your subnet to MetaMask, and deploy essential smart contracts for your game.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of blockchain and smart contracts
- Installed MetaMask wallet
- Familiarity with Solidity and Remix

## Steps to Set Up Your DeFi Kingdom Clone

### 1. Set Up Your EVM Subnet

1. **Follow the Guide**: Use our comprehensive guide alongside the Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet. 
   - [Our Guide](#) (link to your guide)
   - [Avalanche Documentation](https://docs.avax.network/)

2. **Subnet Creation**: 
   - Set up your Avalanche node.
   - Create a new subnet and configure the validators.
   - Deploy your custom EVM to this subnet.

### 2. Define Your Native Currency

1. **Configure Currency**:
   - Define and deploy your own native currency contract on your EVM subnet.
   - This currency will be used as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.
   
2. **Currency Contract**: Write a Solidity contract for your native currency or use an existing template. Deploy this contract using Remix.

### 3. Connect to MetaMask

1. **Add Custom Network**: Connect your EVM subnet to MetaMask by following these steps:
   - Open MetaMask and go to the network dropdown.
   - Select "Custom RPC".
   - Enter the details of your EVM subnet (RPC URL, Chain ID, etc.).

2. **Verify Connection**: Ensure your MetaMask wallet is connected to your subnet and displaying your native currency.

### 4. Deploy Basic Building Blocks

1. **Use Solidity and Remix**: Deploy the basic building blocks of your game using Solidity and Remix. These building blocks include smart contracts for:
   - **Battling**: Define the rules and mechanics for battles between players.
   - **Exploring**: Set up the mechanics for exploring the game world.
   - **Trading**: Create smart contracts for trading items and currencies within the game.

2. **Example Contracts**: Start with basic templates and customize them for your gameâ€™s specific requirements.
   - **Liquidity Pools**: Set up smart contracts to manage in-game liquidity pools.
   - **Tokens**: Define in-game tokens that represent assets or items.

3. **Deploy and Test**: Deploy these contracts on your EVM subnet and test them thoroughly to ensure they function correctly within the game context.
